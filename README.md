# GenerativeModels
This repository contains implementations of most of the models discussed by Harshvardhan GM's survey paper titled "A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis of Generative Models in Machine Learning".

Just open the corresponding folder and you may find the source code for the model. 
Proper credits have been provided wherever necessary in the source codes at the top as a multi line commennt.


This repository is meant to be the technical-side presentation of all the generative models discussed in the paper.
